Tunes Playlist Converter is a project written to fill the gap between iTunes and Android, while not switching to another music management system. Having used [iTunes Agent](http://ita.sourceforge.net/) for awhile, and waiting for their next version, this project was born and supersedes it in many aspects (see features below).

v2.0 is written in Java and available to Windows and Mac OS X.

See the [HowToUse](HowToUse.md) page for a How-To Guide.
