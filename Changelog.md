# Brief Introduction #

Tunes Playlist Converter is a project written to fill the gap between iTunes and Android, while not switching to another music management system. Having used [iTunes Agent](http://ita.sourceforge.net/) for awhile, and waiting for their next version, this project was born and supersedes it in many aspects.
